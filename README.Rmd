> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Non-Parametric Interactions and Effect Modifications using Stochastic Interventions
__Authors:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

## What's `SuperNOVA`?

The `SuperNOVA` R package is designed to provide facilities to data-adaptively identify 
variable sets that are most predictive of an outcome of interest and construct
efficient estimators for the counterfactual mean of an outcome under
stochastic interventions on these variables. Stochastic interventions are shifts
to the exposures that depend on the naturally observed values
[@diaz2012population; @haneuse2013estimation]. `SuperNOVA` builds off of the `txshift` 
package which implements the targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator
of a stochastic shift causal parameter originally proposed by @diaz2018stochastic. `SuperNOVA` extends 
the original stochastic intervention methodology from one treatment/exposure variable to include
joint stochastic interventions on two variables which allows for the construction of a non-parametric
interaction parameter and mediation. Likewise, `SuperNOVA` also estimates both individual stochastic intervention outcomes
under some delta shift compared to outcome under no intervention and a target parameter for effect modification which
is the difference in mean outcomes under intervention compared to no intervention across strata of an effect modifier which is data-adaptively determined.

Of course, it is not known a priori in most cases what variables are interacting or modifying effects (especially in the case of a mixed exposure) and 
therefore it is necessary to identify these variable sets first. As such `SuperNOVA` uses k-fold cross-validation framework to estimate a data-adaptive parameter in training folds and a non-parametric interaction target parameter in estimation folds. Our data-adaptive parameters are variable sets used in basis functions in the best fitting multivariate adaptive regression spline model or highly adaptive lasso model. The best fitting model is determined using a Super Learner which selects the model from an ensemble with the lowest cross-validated MSE. Variable sets are considered important based on ANOVA-like variance decompositions for the basis functions in the best fitting model. Individual variables and variable sets used in all the training folds are considered consistent predictors. The interaction target parameter is applied to variable sets composed of two variables in the mixed exposure. This target parameter is the expected outcome under a dual shift of both variables by some delta compared to the sum of individual shifts. Other parameters exist for effect modification and individual variable shifts. Cross-validated targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) is used to update the initial expected outcomes given stochastic shift interventions.  This method, called SuperNOVA, guarantees consistency, efficiency, and multiple robustness. SuperNOVA provides researchers with k-fold specific and pooled results for each target parameter. Additional information is provided in the vignette. 

`SuperNOVA` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle-sl3-rpkg] to allow for ensemble
machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation procedure for each nuisance parameter 
and estimation of the data-adaptive parameters. 
There are several stacks of machine learning algorithms used that are 
constructed from `sl3` automatically. If the stack parameters are NULL, 
SuperNOVA automatically builds ensembles of machine learning algorithms
that are flexible yet not overly computationally taxing.

## Installation

_Note:_ Because `SuperNOVA` package (currently) depends on `sl3` that allows 
ensemble machine learning to be used for 
nuisance parameter estimation and `sl3` is not on CRAN the `SuperNOVA` package 
is not available on CRAN and must be downloaded here. 


```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/SuperNOVA@main")
```

`SuperNOVA` uses `sl3` so please download sl3 from:
```{r sl3_install, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```


To contribute, install the _mediation_ version of `SuperNOVA` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-devel-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/SuperNOVA@mediation")
```

This is under development and issues should be written in the issues page.

## Example

To illustrate how `SuperNOVA` may be used to ascertain the effect of a mixed exposure, consider the following example:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(SuperNOVA)
library(devtools)
library(kableExtra)

load_all("~/sl3")
set.seed(429153)
# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 100000
```


The `simulate_data` function creates simulated data with a multivariate exposure, covariates (confounders), and a continuous outcome.
```{r simulate data, eval = TRUE}
data <- simulate_data(n_obs = n_obs, shift_var_index = c(3))
effect <- data$effect
data <- data$data
head(data) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Simulated Data") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

The `shift_var_index` parameter above shifts a variable set and gets the expected outcome under this shift. 
Here, we shift our first exposure variable and true effect for this DGP is: 

```{r effect, eval = TRUE}
effect
```

And therefore, in `SuperNOVA` we would expect most of the fold CIs to cover
this number and the pooled estimate to also cover this true effect. Let's
run `SuperNOVA` to see if it correctly identifies the exposures that drive 
the outcome and any interaction/effect modification that exists in the DGP.

Of note, there are three exposures M1, M2, M3 - M1 and M3 have individual effects
and interactions that drive the outcome. There is also effect modification 
between M3 and W1. 


```{r run SuperNOVA, eval = TRUE}
data_sample <- data[sample(nrow(data), 1000), ]

w <- data_sample[, c("W1", "W2")]
a <- data_sample[, c("M1", "M2", "M3")]
y <- data_sample$Y

deltas <- list("M1" = 1, "M2" = 1, "M3" = 1)

ptm <- proc.time()
sim_results <- SuperNOVA(
  w = w,
  a = a,
  y = y,
  delta = deltas,
  n_folds = 2,
  num_cores = 6,
  family = "continuous",
  quantile_thresh = 0,
  seed = 294580
)
proc.time() - ptm

indiv_shift_results <- sim_results$`Indiv Shift Results`
em_results <- sim_results$`Effect Mod Results`
joint_shift_results <- sim_results$`Joint Shift Results`
```

Let's first look at the results for individual stochastic shifts by delta compared to no shift:

```{r individual shift results}
indiv_shift_results$M3 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Individual Stochastic Intervention Results for M1") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Next we can look at effect modifications: 

```{r effect modification results}
em_results$M3W1 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Effect Modification Stochastic Intervention Results for M3 and W1") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

And finally results for the joint shift which is a joint shift compared to additive individual shifts.

```{r joint results}
joint_shift_results$M1M3 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Interactions Stochastic Intervention Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

```
