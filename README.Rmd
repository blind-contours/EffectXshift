> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Non-Parametric Interactions and Effect Modifications using Stochastic Interventions
__Authors:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

---

## What's `SuperNOVA`?

The `SuperNOVA` R package is designed to provide facilities to data-adaptively identify 
variable sets that are most predictive of an outcome of interest and construct
efficient estimators for the counterfactual mean of an outcome under
stochastic interventions on these variables. Stochastic interventions are shifts
to the exposures that depend on the naturally observed values
[@diaz2012population; @haneuse2013estimation]. `SuperNOVA` builds off of the `txshift` 
package which implements the targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator
of a stochastic shift causal parameter originally proposed by @diaz2018stochastic. `SuperNOVA` extends 
the original stochastic intervention methodology from one treatment/exposure variable to include
joint stochastic interventions on two variables which allows for the construction of a non-parametric
interaction parameter. Likewise, `SuperNOVA` also estimates both individual stochastic intervention outcomes
under some delta shift compared to outcome under no intervention and a target parameter for effect modification which
is the difference in mean outcomes under intervention compared to no intervention across strata of an effect modifier. 

Of course, it is not known a priori in most cases what variables are interacting or modifying effects and 
therefore it is necessary to identify these variable sets first. As such `SuperNOVA` uses V-fold cross-validation framework to estimate a data-adaptive parameter in training folds and a non-parametric interaction target parameter in estimation folds. Our data-adaptive parameters are variable sets used in basis functions in the best fitting multivariate adaptive regression spline model. The best fitting model is determined using a Super Learner which selects the model from an ensemble with the lowest cross-validated MSE. Variable sets are considered important based on ANOVA-like variance decompositions for the basis functions in the best fitting model. Individual variables and variable sets used in all the training folds are considered consistent predictors. The interaction target parameter is applied to variable sets composed of two variables in the mixed exposure. This target parameter is the expected outcome under a dual shift of both variables by some delta compared to the sum of individual shifts. Other parameters exist for effect modification and individual variable shifts. Cross-validated targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) is used to update the initial expected outcomes given stochastic shift interventions.  This method, called SuperNOVA, guarantees consistency, efficiency, and multiple robustness. SuperNOVA provides researchers with V-fold specific and pooled results for each target parameter. Additional information is provided in the vignette. 

`SuperNOVA` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle-sl3-rpkg] to allow for ensemble
machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation procedure for each nuisance parameter 
and estimation of the data-adaptive parameters in the iterative backfitting procedure used to identify basis functions in the best fittin model. There are several stacks of machine learning algorithms used that are constructed from `sl3`.

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SuperNOVA) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("SuperNOVA")
```

_Note:_ If `SuperNOVA` is installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SuperNOVA), the `sl3`, an enhancing
dependency that allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance
parameter estimation, won't be included. We highly recommend additionally     
installing `sl3` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r sl3-gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```

For the latest features, install the most recent _stable version_  of `SuperNOVA`
from GitHub via [`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/SuperNOVA@main")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `SuperNOVA` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-devel-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/SuperNOVA@devel")
```

## Example

To illustrate how `SuperNOVA` may be used to ascertain the effect of a mixed exposure, consider the following example:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(SuperNOVA)
library(devtools)
load_all('~/sl3')
set.seed(429153)
# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 400
```


The `simulate_data` function creates simulated data with a multivariate exposure, covariates (confounders), and a continuous outcome.
```{r simulate data, eval = TRUE}
data_info <- simulate_data(n_obs = n_obs)
data <- data_info$data
head(data)
```

```{r setup learner stacks}

## this is the stack of learners to learn the density of our exposures, or the g mechanism
sl_density_lrnr <- make_density_superlearner()

# this stack will be used to find basis functions in the mixture during an iterative backfitting procedure, details in vignette
Lrnr_earth_1 <- Lrnr_earth$new(linpreds = FALSE, degree = 1)
Lrnr_earth_2 <- Lrnr_earth$new(linpreds = FALSE, degree = 2)
Lrnr_earth_3 <- Lrnr_earth$new(linpreds = FALSE, degree = 2, pmethod = "none")

learners <- c(
  Lrnr_earth_1,
  Lrnr_earth_2,
  Lrnr_earth_3
)

names(learners) <- c(
  "full earth 1",
  "full earth 2",
  "full earth 3"
)

Exposures_stack <- make_learner(Stack, learners)

## this is the stack of learners used to estimate Y given covariates in the iterative backfitting procedure

Lrnr_glm_basic <- Lrnr_glm$new()
Lrnr_mean_base <- Lrnr_mean$new()

Lrnr_ridge <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(alpha = 0)
Lrnr_lasso <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(alpha = 1)

learners <- c(
  Lrnr_earth_1,
  Lrnr_earth_2,
  Lrnr_earth_3,
  Lrnr_glm_basic,
  Lrnr_mean_base,
  Lrnr_ridge,
  Lrnr_lasso
)

names(learners) <- c(
  "full earth 1",
  "full earth 2",
  "full earth 3",
  "Lrnr_glm",
  "Lrnr_mean",
  "Lrnr_ridge",
  "Lrnr_lasso"
)

Covariate_stack <- make_learner(Stack, learners)

## and now we make the estimators for our Q or outcome mechanism: 

mean_lrnr <- Lrnr_mean$new()
fglm_lrnr <- Lrnr_glm_fast$new()
rf_lrnr <- Lrnr_ranger$new()
lasso_learner <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(alpha = 1)
ridge_learner <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(alpha = 0)
lrn_polspline <- Lrnr_polspline$new()
lrn_ranger100 <- make_learner(Lrnr_ranger, num.trees = 100)
hal_lrnr <- Lrnr_hal9001$new(max_degree = 3, n_folds = 3)

Outcome_stack <- make_learner(
  Stack, mean_lrnr, fglm_lrnr, rf_lrnr, lasso_learner, ridge_learner, lrn_polspline, lrn_ranger100, Lrnr_earth_1, Lrnr_earth_2, Lrnr_earth_3
)

```




```{r run SuperNOVA, eval = TRUE}
W <- data[, c("W2", "W3")]
A <- data[, c("M1", "M2", "M3")]
V <- data[, c("W1")]
Y <- data[, c("Y")]


sim_results <- SuperNOVA(W = W,
                         V = V,
                         A = A,
                         Y = Y,
                         delta = 1,
                         LOD_val = 0,
                         Density_stack = sl_density_lrnr,
                         Exposures_stack = Exposures_stack,
                         Covariate_stack = Covariate_stack,
                         Outcome_stack = Outcome_stack,
                         n_folds = 3,
                         family = "continuous",
                         quantile_thresh = 0) 

indiv_shift_results <- sim_results$`Indiv Shift Results`
em_results <- sim_results$`Effect Mod Results`
joint_shift_results <- sim_results$`Joint Shift Results`
```

Let's first look at the results for individual stochastic shifts by delta compared to no shift:

```{r individual shift results}
indiv_shift_results
```

Next we can look at effect modifications: 

```{r effect modification results}
em_results
```

And finally results for the joint shift

```{r joint results}
joint_shift_results
```
