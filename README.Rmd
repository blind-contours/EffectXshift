> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Non-Parametric Interactions and Effect Modifications using Stochastic Interventions
__Authors:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

## What's `SuperNOVA`?

The `SuperNOVA` R package provides users with the tools necessary to identify the most predictive variable sets for a given outcome and develop efficient estimators for the counterfactual mean of the outcome under stochastic interventions on those variables. These interventions are shifts to the exposures that are dependent on naturally observed values [@diaz2012population; @haneuse2013estimation]. Building on the `txshift` package, which implements the TML estimator for a stochastic shift causal parameter, `SuperNOVA` extends this methodology to include joint stochastic interventions on two variables, allowing for the construction of a non-parametric interaction parameter and mediation (in development). Additionally, `SuperNOVA` estimates individual stochastic intervention outcomes under some delta shift compared to the outcome under no intervention, and a target parameter for effect modification, which is the mean outcome under intervention in regions of the covariate space that are also data-adaptively determined.

The `SuperNOVA` package provides a comprehensive solution for identifying variable sets that interact or modify effects in the context of mixed exposures. To achieve this, we use a k-fold cross-validation framework to estimate a data-adaptive parameter, namely, stochastic shift target parameters for variable sets that are discovered to be predictive of the outcome. We ensure unbiased estimation of the data-adaptive parameter by employing cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimation. In this approach, we split the data into parameter-generating and estimation samples. In the parameter-generating sample, we fit an ensemble of basis function estimators to the data and select the estimator with the lowest cross-validated mean squared error. We then extract important variable sets using ANOVA-like variance decomposition of the linear combination of basis functions. In the estimation fold, we use targeted learning to estimate causal target parameters for interaction, effect modification, and individual variable shifts. That is, we estimate the counterfactual mean different of these discovered variable sets under a shift of $\delta$ (an amount to shift an exposure by) compared to the observed outcome under observed exposure. `SuperNOVA` is a versatile tool that provides researchers with k-fold specific and pooled results for each target parameter. More details are available in the accompanying vignette.

Users simply input a vector for exposures, covariates, and an outcome. The user also specifies the respective $\delta$ for each exposure (the amount to shift by) and if this delta should be adaptive based on positivity violations (see vignette). `SuperNOVA` comes with flexible default machine learning algorithms used in the data-adaptive procedure and for estimation of each of the nuisance parameters. Given these inputs `SuperNOVA` outputs tables for fold specific results (say exposure 1 under shifts for each fold it was found predictive) and pooled results which uses a pooled TMLE fluctuation across the folds to esimate an average effect. 


`SuperNOVA` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle-sl3-rpkg] to allow for ensemble
machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation procedure for each nuisance parameter 
and estimation of the data-adaptive parameters. 
There are several stacks of machine learning algorithms used that are 
constructed from `sl3` automatically. If the stack parameters are NULL, 
SuperNOVA automatically builds ensembles of machine learning algorithms
that are flexible yet not overly computationally taxing.

## Installation

*Note:* Because the `SuperNOVA` package (currently) depends on `sl3` that
allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance parameter
estimation and `sl3` is not on CRAN the `SuperNOVA` package is not
available on CRAN and must be downloaded here.

There are many depedencies for `SuperNOVA` so it's easier to break up 
installation of the various packages to ensure proper installation. 

First install the basis estimators used in the data-adaptive
variable discovery of the exposure and covariate space: 

```{r tree-packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("earth")
install.packages("hal9001")
```

`SuperNOVA` uses the `sl3` package to build ensemble machine learners for each nuisance parameter. 
We have to install off the development branch, first download these two packages for `sl3`

```{r super-learner-packages,  eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("ranger", "arm", "xgboost", "nnls"))
```

Now install `sl3` on devel:

```{r sl3_devel,  eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```

Make sure `sl3` installs correctly then install `SuperNOVA`

```{r SuperNOVA_install,  eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/SuperNOVA@main")
```

`SuperNOVA` has some other miscellaneous dependencies that are used in the examples as well as in the plotting functions. 

```{r msc_package,  eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("kableExtra", "hrbrthemes", "viridis"))
```

---

## Example

To illustrate how `SuperNOVA` may be used to ascertain the effect of a mixed exposure, consider the following example:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(SuperNOVA)
library(devtools)
library(kableExtra)
library(sl3)

set.seed(429153)
# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 100000
```



The `simulate_data` is a function for generating synthetic data with a complex structure to study the causal effects of shifting values in the mixtures of exposures The primary purpose of this simulation is to provide a controlled environment for testing and validating estimates given by the SuperNOVA package.

The simulate_data function generates synthetic data for n_obs observations with a pre-specified covariance structure (sigma_mod) and a shift parameter (delta). It simulates four mixture components (M1, M2, M3, M4) and three covariates (W1, W2, W3) with specific relationships between them. The outcome variable Y is generated as a function of these mixtures and covariates.

After generating the data, the function applies a shift (delta) to each mixture component separately and calculates the average treatment effect for each component. Additionally, it calculates the interaction effect of shifting two mixture components simultaneously (m14_intxn). These ground truth effects can be used for validating and comparing the performance of various causal inference methods on this synthetic dataset.

The function returns a list containing the generated data and the ground truth effects of the shifts applied to each mixture component, the interaction effect, and the modified effect results based on a specific level in the W3 covariate.


```{r simulate data, eval = TRUE}
sim_out <- simulate_data(n_obs = n_obs)
data <- sim_out$data
head(data) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Simulated Data") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```



And therefore, in `SuperNOVA` we would expect most of the fold CIs to cover
this number and the pooled estimate to also cover this true effect. Let's
run `SuperNOVA` to see if it correctly identifies the exposures that drive 
the outcome and any interaction/effect modification that exists in the DGP.

Of note, there are three exposures M1, M2, M3 - M1 and M3 have individual effects
and interactions that drive the outcome. There is also effect modification 
between M3 and W1. 


```{r run SuperNOVA, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_sample <- data[sample(nrow(data), 4000), ]

w <- data_sample[, c("W1", "W2", "W3")]
a <- data_sample[, c("M1", "M2", "M3", "M4")]
y <- data_sample$Y

deltas <- list("M1" = 1, "M2" = 1, "M3" = 1, "M4" = 1)

ptm <- proc.time()
sim_results <- SuperNOVA(
  w = w,
  a = a,
  y = y,
  delta = deltas,
  n_folds = 3,
  num_cores = 6,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  quantile_thresh = 0,
  seed = 294580
)
proc.time() - ptm

basis_in_folds <- sim_results$`Basis Fold Proportions`
indiv_shift_results <- sim_results$`Indiv Shift Results`
em_results <- sim_results$`Effect Mod Results`
joint_shift_results <- sim_results$`Joint Shift Results`
```

Let's first look at the variable relationships used in the folds: 

```{r basis in folds}
basis_in_folds
```

The above list shows that marginal effects for exposures M1 and M4 were found, an interaction for M1 and M4, and effect modification for M3 and W3 - all of which are correct as the outcome is generated from these relationships. There is no effect for M2 which we correctly reject.

Let's first look at the results for individual stochastic shifts by delta compared to no shift:

```{r individual shift results}
indiv_shift_results$M1 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Individual Stochastic Intervention Results for M1") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

The true effect for a shifted M1 vs observed M1 is: 
```{r m1 truth}
sim_out$m1_effect
```

And so we see that we have proper coverage.

Next we can look at effect modifications: 

```{r effect modification results}
em_results$M3W3 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Effect Modification Stochastic Intervention Results for M3 and W3") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Let's first look at the truth: 
```{r em truth}
sim_out$effect_mod
```
When W3 is greater than 0 the truth effect is 11, our estimates are 10 with CI coverage. When W3 is 0 the truth is 1, our estimate is 1.9 with CIs that cover the truth as well. 

And finally results for the joint shift which is a joint shift compared to additive individual shifts.

```{r joint results}
joint_shift_results$M1M4 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Interactions Stochastic Intervention Results for M1 and M4") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Let's look at the truth again: 

```{r interaction truths}
sim_out$m1_effect
sim_out$m4_effect
sim_out$m14_effect
sim_out$m14_intxn
```
So comparing the results to the above table in the pooled section we can see all our estimates for the marginal shifts, dual shift, and difference between dual and sum of marginals have CIs that cover the truth.
