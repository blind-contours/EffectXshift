> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Non-Parametric Interactions and Effect Modifications using Stochastic Interventions
__Authors:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

## What's `SuperNOVA`?

The `SuperNOVA` R package provides users with the tools necessary to identify the most predictive variable sets for a given outcome and develop efficient estimators for the counterfactual mean of the outcome under stochastic interventions on those variables. These interventions are shifts to the exposures that are dependent on naturally observed values [@diaz2012population; @haneuse2013estimation]. Building on the `txshift` package, which implements the TML estimator for a stochastic shift causal parameter, `SuperNOVA` extends this methodology to include joint stochastic interventions on two variables, allowing for the construction of a non-parametric interaction parameter and mediation (in development). Additionally, `SuperNOVA` estimates individual stochastic intervention outcomes under some delta shift compared to the outcome under no intervention, and a target parameter for effect modification, which is the mean outcome under intervention in regions of the covariate space that are also data-adaptively determined.

The `SuperNOVA` package provides a comprehensive solution for identifying variable sets that interact or modify effects in the context of mixed exposures. To achieve this, we use a k-fold cross-validation framework to estimate a data-adaptive parameter, namely, stochastic shift target parameters for variable sets that are discovered to be predictive of the outcome. We ensure unbiased estimation of the data-adaptive parameter by employing cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimation. In this approach, we split the data into parameter-generating and estimation samples. In the parameter-generating sample, we fit an ensemble of basis function estimators to the data and select the estimator with the lowest cross-validated mean squared error. We then extract important variable sets using ANOVA-like variance decomposition of the linear combination of basis functions. In the estimation fold, we use targeted learning to estimate causal target parameters for interaction, effect modification, and individual variable shifts. That is, we estimate the counterfactual mean different of these discovered variable sets under a shift of $\delta$ (an amount to shift an exposure by) compared to the observed outcome under observed exposure. `SuperNOVA` is a versatile tool that provides researchers with k-fold specific and pooled results for each target parameter. More details are available in the accompanying vignette.

Users simply input a vector for exposures, covariates, and an outcome. The user also specifies the respective $\delta$ for each exposure (the amount to shift by) and if this delta should be adaptive based on positivity violations (see vignette). `SuperNOVA` comes with flexible default machine learning algorithms used in the data-adaptive procedure and for estimation of each of the nuisance parameters. Given these inputs `SuperNOVA` outputs tables for fold specific results (say exposure 1 under shifts for each fold it was found predictive) and pooled results which uses a pooled TMLE fluctuation across the folds to esimate an average effect. 


`SuperNOVA` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle-sl3-rpkg] to allow for ensemble
machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation procedure for each nuisance parameter 
and estimation of the data-adaptive parameters. 
There are several stacks of machine learning algorithms used that are 
constructed from `sl3` automatically. If the stack parameters are NULL, 
SuperNOVA automatically builds ensembles of machine learning algorithms
that are flexible yet not overly computationally taxing.

## Installation

*Note:* Because the `SuperNOVA` package (currently) depends on `sl3` that
allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance parameter
estimation and `sl3` is not on CRAN the `SuperNOVA` package is not
available on CRAN and must be downloaded here.

There are many depedencies for `SuperNOVA` so it's easier to break up 
installation of the various packages to ensure proper installation. 

First install the basis estimators used in the data-adaptive
variable discovery of the exposure and covariate space: 

```{r tree-packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("earth")
install.packages("hal9001")
```

`SuperNOVA` uses the `sl3` package to build ensemble machine learners for each nuisance parameter. 
We have to install off the development branch, first download these two packages for `sl3`

```{r super-learner-packages,  eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("ranger", "arm", "xgboost", "nnls"))
```

Now install `sl3` on devel:

```{r sl3_devel,  eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```

Make sure `sl3` installs correctly then install `SuperNOVA`

```{r SuperNOVA_install,  eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/SuperNOVA@main")
```

`SuperNOVA` has some other miscellaneous dependencies that are used in the examples as well as in the plotting functions. 

```{r msc_package,  eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("kableExtra", "hrbrthemes", "viridis"))
```

## Example

To illustrate how `SuperNOVA` may be used to ascertain the effect of a mixed exposure, consider the following example:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(SuperNOVA)
library(devtools)
library(kableExtra)
library(sl3)

set.seed(429153)
# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 100000
```


The `simulate_data` function creates simulated data with a multivariate exposure, covariates (confounders), and a continuous outcome.

```{r simulate data, eval = TRUE}
data <- simulate_data(n_obs = n_obs, shift_var_index = c(3))
effect <- data$effect
data <- data$data
head(data) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Simulated Data") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

The `shift_var_index` parameter above shifts a variable set and gets the expected outcome under this shift. 
Here, we shift our first exposure variable and true effect for this DGP is: 

```{r effect, eval = TRUE}
effect
```

And therefore, in `SuperNOVA` we would expect most of the fold CIs to cover
this number and the pooled estimate to also cover this true effect. Let's
run `SuperNOVA` to see if it correctly identifies the exposures that drive 
the outcome and any interaction/effect modification that exists in the DGP.

Of note, there are three exposures M1, M2, M3 - M1 and M3 have individual effects
and interactions that drive the outcome. There is also effect modification 
between M3 and W1. 


```{r run SuperNOVA, eval = TRUE}
data_sample <- data[sample(nrow(data), 1000), ]

w <- data_sample[, c("W1", "W2")]
a <- data_sample[, c("M1", "M2", "M3")]
y <- data_sample$Y

deltas <- list("M1" = 1, "M2" = 1, "M3" = 1)

ptm <- proc.time()
sim_results <- SuperNOVA(
  w = w,
  a = a,
  y = y,
  delta = deltas,
  n_folds = 2,
  num_cores = 6,
  family = "continuous",
  quantile_thresh = 0,
  seed = 294580
)
proc.time() - ptm

indiv_shift_results <- sim_results$`Indiv Shift Results`
em_results <- sim_results$`Effect Mod Results`
joint_shift_results <- sim_results$`Joint Shift Results`
```

Let's first look at the results for individual stochastic shifts by delta compared to no shift:

```{r individual shift results}
indiv_shift_results$M3 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Individual Stochastic Intervention Results for M1") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Next we can look at effect modifications: 

```{r effect modification results}
em_results$M3W1 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Effect Modification Stochastic Intervention Results for M3 and W1") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

And finally results for the joint shift which is a joint shift compared to additive individual shifts.

```{r joint results}
joint_shift_results$M1M3 %>%
  kbl(caption = "Interactions Stochastic Intervention Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
