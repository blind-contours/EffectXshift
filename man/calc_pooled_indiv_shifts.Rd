\title{Compute the Pooled Shift Parameter Estimate From the Fold Specific Results}
\usage{
calc_pooled_indiv_shifts(
  basis_prop_in_fold,
  indiv_shift_results,
  estimator = c("tmle", "onestep"),
  fluc_mod_out = NULL,
  delta,
  fluctuation
)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimator}{The type of estimator to be fit, either \code{"tmle"} for
targeted maximum likelihood estimation or \code{"onestep"} for a one-step
estimator.}

\item{fluc_mod_out}{An object giving values of the logistic tilting model
for targeted minimum loss estimation. This type of object should be the
output of the internal routines to perform this step of the TML estimation
procedure, as given by \code{\link{fit_fluctuation}}.}

\item{Y}{A \code{numeric} vector of the observed outcomes.}

\item{Qn}{An object providing the value of the outcome evaluated after
imposing a shift in the treatment. This object is passed in after being
constructed by a call to the internal function \code{est_Q}.}

\item{Hn}{An object providing values of the auxiliary ("clever") covariate,
constructed from the treatment mechanism and required for targeted minimum
loss-based estimation. This object object should be passed in after being
constructed by a call to the internal function \code{est_Hn}.}

\item{C_samp}{Indicator for missingness due to exclusion from second-phase
sample. Used for compatibility with the IPCW-TML estimation routine.}

\item{ipc_weights}{A \code{numeric} vector that gives inverse probability of
censoring weights for each observation. These are generated by invoking the
routines for estimating the censoring mechanism.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing the parameter estimate, estimated variance
based on the efficient influence function (EIF), the estimate of the EIF
incorporating inverse probability of censoring weights, and the estimate of
the EIF without the application of such weights.
}
\description{
Compute the Pooled Shift Parameter Estimate From the Fold Specific Results
}
\details{
Estimate the value of the pooledcausal parameter alongside statistical
inference for the parameter estimate based on the nuisance parameters from
the fold specific results. We stack the nuisance parameters needed to
compute the efficient influence
function of the target parameter, which takes the following form:
\%D(P)(o) = H(a,w)(y - \bar{Q}(a,w)) + \bar{Q}(d(a,w)) - \psi(P)
}
