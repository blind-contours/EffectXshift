## Motivation 

The motivation behind the package InterXshift is to address the limitations of traditional statistical methods in environmental epidemiology studies. Analysts are often interested in understanding the joint impact of a mixed exposure, i.e. a vector of exposures, but the most important exposures and exposure sets remain unknown. Traditional methods make overly simplistic assumptions, such as linear and additive relationships, and the resulting statistical quantities may not be directly applicable to public policy decisions.


## Target Parameter 

To overcome these limitations, InterXshift uses data-adaptive machine learning methods to identify the exposures and exposure sets that have the most synergy or antagonism. This is defined based on our target parameter: 

$$
\begin{align}
    \Psi_{\text{IE}} = &E[Y | A_i + \delta_i, A_j + \delta_j, \mathbf{A}_{- i,j}, W] \nonumber \\
              &- \big(E[Y | A_i + \delta_i, \mathbf{A}_{- i}, W] + E[Y | A_j + \delta_j, \mathbf{A}_{- j}, W]\big) \nonumber \\
              &+ E[Y]
  \end{align}

$$

Which measures the expected outcome under a shift of two exposures to the sum of their individual impacts. The exposure sets with the largest positive values have synergy meaning their joint impact is more than additive. The exposure sets with the largest negative value have the most antagonism. 

## G-computation Approximation

To identify the most synergistic and antagonistic exposure sets we employ a g-computation framework. We first construct a super learner, or ensemble of machine learning algorithms. We then construct all two-way combinations and for each combination calculate our interaction. We rank these results and select the top positive and negative results which represent synergy and antagonism. 


## Sample Splitting 

Because we don't know which exposure sets to estimate our interaction parameter on a priori, we need to split our data and in the training fold find the exposure sets, using the above g-computation framework, and in an estimation sample, efficiently estimate the interaction parameter for these exposure sets so that we can get valid confidence intervals for these data-adaptively identified interactions. This is done using targeted learning.


## Targeted Learning

We use targeted minimum loss based estimation (TMLE) to debias our initial outcome estimates given a shift in exposure such that the resulting estimator is asymptotically unbiased and has the smallest variance. This procedure involves constructing a least favorable submodel which uses a ratio of conditional exposure densities under shift and now shift as a covariate to debias the initial estimates. More details of targeted learning for stochastic shifts are here @diaz2012population


## Data Adaptive Delta

For each exposure, the user inputs a respective delta, for example for exposures $M1, M2, M3$ the analyst puts in the `deltas` vector 

```{r deltas, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
deltas <- c("M1" = 1, "M2" = 2.3, "M3" = 1.4)
```

Which assigns a delta shift amount to each exposure. However, because the user doesn't know the underlying experimentation in the data, a delta that is too big may result in positivity violations which leads to bias and high variance of the estimator. That is, if the user asks for a shift in exposure density that is very unlikely given the data. To solve this, the analyst can also choose to set `adaptive_delta = TRUE` which then makes the shift amount a data adaptive parameter as well. The delta will be reduced until the max of the ratio of densities for each exposure is less than or equal to `hn_trunc_thresh`.

## Inputs and Outputs 

InterXshift takes in covariates, exposures, an outcome, a list of deltas to shift each exposure by, the estimator (tmle or one step) number of folds for the CV procedure, parallelization parameters and if the delta should be data-adaptive. Also the user defines top_n which is the number of ranked synergistic, antagonistic and individual positive and negative effects to extract from the mixed exposure.

The package then outputs K-fold specific results, the result found in each fold, and the oracle result which is the parameter that is pooled across all the folds. For example, we will get the fold specific synergy results for the rank 1 and rank 2 exposure sets found to have the highest expectation under joint shift compared to positive shift. The pooled parameter is the oracle rank 1, meaning we do a pooled TMLE for all the rank 1 findings across the folds. The same is true for the other parameters. 


We get pooled rank synergy, antagonism, positive and negative effects. If the same exposure sets are used across the folds, the pooled estimate is interpretable and has greater power compared to k-fold. If not, the analyst must investigate the k-fold specific results and report consistency of findings. 

## NHANES Data

Here we will try and replicate the analysis by Gibson et. al., 
https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-019-0515-1

and Mitro et. al, 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4858394/

Who used the NHANES 2001-2002 data to investigate 18 POP exposures on telomere length. 

Because reduced telomere length is associated with more biological aging and higher morbidity, we 
will try and identify which region in the POP space would maximize telomere length. That is, 
we want to find the region that, if we created a regulation on those chemicals, would result in maximal change in elongating telomere length. 

Let's first load the data and investigate the variables: 

## NHANES Data 


```{r NHANES data and variables}
data("NHANES_eurocim")

exposures <- c("LBX074LA", # PCB74 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBX099LA", # PCB99 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBX118LA", # PCB118 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBX138LA", # PCB138 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBX153LA", # PCB153 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBX170LA", # PCB170 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBX180LA", # PCB180 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBX187LA", # PCB187 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBX194LA", # PCB194 Lipid Adj (ng/g)
               "LBXD03LA", # 1,2,3,6,7,8-hxcdd Lipid Adj (pg/g)
               "LBXD05LA", # 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hpcdd Lipid Adj (pg/g)
               "LBXD07LA", # 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-ocdd Lipid Adj (pg/g)
               "LBXF03LA", # 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf Lipid Adj (pg/g)
               "LBXF04LA", # 1,2,3,4,7,8-hxcdf Lipid Adj (pg/g)
               "LBXF05LA", # 1,2,3,6,7,8-hxcdf Lipid Adj (pg/g)
               "LBXF08LA", # 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hxcdf Lipid Adj (pg/g)
               "LBXHXCLA", # 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hxcb Lipid Adj (pg/g)
               "LBXPCBLA") # 3,3',4,4',5-pcnb Lipid Adj (pg/g)

NHANES_eurocim <- NHANES_eurocim[complete.cases(NHANES_eurocim[, exposures]), ]

outcome <- "TELOMEAN"

covariates <- c("LBXWBCSI", # White blood cell count (SI)
                "LBXLYPCT", # Lymphocyte percent (%)
                "LBXMOPCT", # Monocyte percent (%)
                "LBXEOPCT", # Eosinophils percent (%)
                "LBXBAPCT", # Basophils percent (%)
                "LBXNEPCT", # Segmented neutrophils percent (%)
                "male", # Sex
                "age_cent", # Age at Screening, centered
                "race_cat", # race
                "bmi_cat3", # Body Mass Index (kg/m**2)
                "ln_lbxcot", # Cotinine (ng/mL), log-transformed
                "edu_cat") # Education Level - Adults 20+


```

To improve consistency in the region we find to be the maximizing region, it is best to remove an exposure of highly correlated sets, we do that here: 

```{r remove correlated exposures}
# Calculate the correlation matrix for the exposures
cor_matrix <- cor(NHANES_eurocim[, exposures], use = "complete.obs")

# Set a threshold for high correlation
threshold <- 0.8

# Find pairs of highly correlated exposures
highly_correlated_pairs <- which(abs(cor_matrix) > threshold & lower.tri(cor_matrix), arr.ind = TRUE)

# Initiate a vector to keep track of exposures to remove
exposures_to_remove <- c()

# Loop through the highly correlated pairs and decide which exposure to remove
for (pair in seq_len(nrow(highly_correlated_pairs))) {
  row <- highly_correlated_pairs[pair, "row"]
  col <- highly_correlated_pairs[pair, "col"]

  if (!(colnames(cor_matrix)[row] %in% exposures_to_remove)) {
    exposures_to_remove <- c(exposures_to_remove, colnames(cor_matrix)[row])
  }
}

# Keep only uncorrelated exposures
exposures_to_keep <- setdiff(exposures, exposures_to_remove)

```


## Run CVtreeMLE 

```{r run CVtreeMLE for NHANES, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
deltas <- list(
  "LBX074LA" = 1, "LBX099LA" = 1, "LBXD03LA" = 1,
  "LBXD05LA" = 1, "LBXF03LA" = 1, "LBXF04LA" = 1, "LBXF08LA" = 1, 
  "LBXPCBLA" = 1
)

ptm <- proc.time()

w <- NHANES_eurocim[, covariates]
a <- NHANES_eurocim[, exposures_to_keep]
y <- NHANES_eurocim$TELOMEAN

NIEH_results <- InterXshift(
  w = w,
  a = a,
  y = y,
  deltas = deltas,
  n_folds = 4,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  parallel = TRUE,
  parallel_type = "multi_session",
  num_cores = 4,
  seed = seed,
  adaptive_delta = FALSE,
  top_n = 1
)

proc.time() - ptm
```


## Investigating Results

One note is that for this example we will get more variability than normal because we only run 3 fold CV due to computational time. 

Let's first look at the results for each fold: 


```{r positive results, eval = TRUE}
NIEH_results$`Pos Shift Results by Rank` %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Top Positive Effects") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
Here we see LBXF03LA is found in all the folds for the top positive effects. The pooled effect indicates that for a 1-unit increase telomere length increases by 0.008 with p = 0.35. 

```{r negative results, eval = TRUE}
NIEH_results$`Neg Shift Results by Rank` %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Top Negative Effects") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Here we see some inconsistency in the top negative result with 2 folds finding LBXD03LA and one fold LBXF08LA. This makes interpreting the pooled estimate difficult. Again more folds fixes this issue. However, the analyst can interpret the k-fold specific results. 


```{r top synergy results, eval = TRUE}
k_fold_synergy <- do.call(rbind, NIEH_results$`K Fold Synergy Results`)

k_fold_synergy %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Top Synergy Effects") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Here we see LBXD03LA-LBXD05LA and LBXD03LA-LBXF08LA are found to be the top synergistic relationships. Above we show the k-fold specific results.

```{r top antagonistic results, eval = TRUE}
k_fold_antagonistic <- do.call(rbind, NIEH_results$`K Fold Antagonism Results`)

k_fold_antagonistic %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Top Antagonistic Effects") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Here we see LBXF03LA-LBXF04LA is found to have the most antagonistic effect in all the folds. In each fold we show the effects of each exposure shifted individually, the joint shift of both together, and comparing the joint shift to the addition of individual shifts. Since this effect was found consistently we can look at the pooled top antagonistic result. 

```{r top pooled antagonistic results, eval = TRUE}

NIEH_results$`Pooled Antagonism Results by Rank` %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Pooled Antagonistic Effects") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
Here we see the results for the pooled individual shifts, which is LBXF03LA, the second exposure LBXF04LA, the expectation under joint shift and the interaction effect.
